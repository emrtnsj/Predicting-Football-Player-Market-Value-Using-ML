Predicting Football Player Market Value Using Machine Learning
Summary
This repository contains the code for a project that explores using machine learning to predict the market value of football players.

Data
Publicly available datasets on football players (names, positions, ages, nationalities, etc.)

Club data (league information, squad size)

Match data (game results, player appearances, goals, assists, etc.)

Key findings and Insights
This project explored the potential of machine learning for predicting football player market value. Here are some key findings and insights:

Feature Engineering Matters: Creating new features from existing player data (e.g., goals per game) enhanced the model's ability to capture relevant factors influencing market value.

Model Selection: Experimenting with various machine learning models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Random Forest) revealed that Gradient Bossting achieved the highest accuracy in predicting market value on our data.

Understanding Market Value: The project provided valuable insights into the factors that influence player market value based on the chosen model's predictions. This knowledge can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of player valuation in the football industry.
